<h3>Hi there âœ‹. In this project, I've created a Checkout Form by using HTML, CSS and DOM. In the project;</h3>
<ul>
  <li>First I've created a responsive web page by using pure HTML & CSS,</li>
  <li>As you can see in the gif image below project includes a form, </li>
  <li>JavaScript code is added in order to check validty of e-mail address,</li>
  <li>Validity check includes a simple Regex statement,</li>
  <li>I've defined variables by using DOM querySelectorAll etc. ,</li>
  <li>For adding Event listeners to plus, minus icons and remove buttons I've used forEach method. I am aware that performance of capturing or bubling is better but in this projet I wanted to test if I can use forEach, </li>
  <li>Navigated through DOM elements by using commands like getElementById, querySelector, querySelectorAll, parentElement etc.,</li>
  <li>When user clicks plus or minus buttons the amount of purchased item increases or decreases respectively,</li>
  <li>A fuction checks whether there is any product in the cart or not then calculates the total amount, </li>
  <li>If user clicks remove button code removes element from DOM and function calculates total amount again,</li>
  <li>Gif image of the project is below ðŸ‘‡. </li>
  <li>Hope you like my project!</li>
  <li>All comments and contributions are welcomed!</li>
</ul>
